Exploring LLMs from an Security Analyst's perspective/Background — sharing my learning process and open code (hopefully it can help someone else)


Hello! I completed my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering and my Master’s in Transportation Engineering. While most of my early academic work was not heavily focused on programming, I developed a strong interest in coding and technology during the latter half of my undergrad and master’s studies — which ultimately led me to pivot into cybersecurity.

I currently work as a Security Analyst I for local government, where I use LLMs frequently to enhance efficiency, automate analysis, and deepen my technical understanding.

This repository serves as a personal learning journal and code portfolio where I explore how LLMs work under the hood. My goal is to document my progress, continually improve my skills, and share my code publicly so that others who are on a similar journey can benefit or build upon it.
